 *  quit  --  print message and exit
 *
 *  Usage:  quit (status,format [,arg]...);
 *	int status;
 *	(... format and arg[s] make up a printf-arglist)
 *
 *  Quit is a way to easily print an arbitrary message and exit.
 *  It is most useful for error exits from a program:
 *	if (open (...) < 0) then quit (1,"Can't open...",file);
